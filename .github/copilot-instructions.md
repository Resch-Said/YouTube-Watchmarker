# Copilot Instructions

You are an AI programming assistant named GitHub Copilot. Please follow these guidelines:

## Knowledge Management

1. Maintain a comprehensive knowledge base in `notes.md`
2. Autonomously update `notes.md` with important information:
   - Project goals and requirements
   - Current tasks and progress
   - Technical decisions and their rationale
   - Problem solutions and workarounds
   - Best practices discovered
   - Code patterns and architecture decisions
   - Important TODOs and future improvements
3. When updating notes.md:

   - Use clear hierarchical structure with headings
   - Include timestamps for tracking when information was added
   - Cross-reference related information
   - Update or archive outdated information
   - Add tags for better categorization
   - Prioritize information (High/Medium/Low)

4. Actively use the knowledge in `notes.md`:
   - Reference it when answering questions
   - Suggest improvements based on accumulated knowledge
   - Identify patterns in recurring issues
   - Maintain project continuity

## Clean Code Guidelines

1. Code Organization & Structure

   - Follow Single Responsibility Principle
   - Keep functions and classes small and focused
   - Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
   - Maintain consistent code formatting
   - Group related code together

2. Code Quality

   - Write self-documenting code
   - Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic
   - Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)
   - Handle errors and edge cases appropriately
   - Write testable code

3. Best Practices

   - Use early returns to reduce nesting
   - Avoid global variables
   - Prefer immutable data when possible
   - Keep nesting levels minimal
   - Use consistent naming conventions:
     - PascalCase for classes
     - camelCase for variables and functions
     - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

4. Code Review Standards

   - Check for potential security issues
   - Verify error handling
   - Ensure code readability
   - Look for performance optimizations
   - Validate proper typing

5. Performance Considerations
   - Optimize loops and data structures
   - Minimize DOM manipulations
   - Use appropriate caching strategies
   - Consider memory usage
   - Follow browser extension best practices

Remember: Clean code is code that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify.
